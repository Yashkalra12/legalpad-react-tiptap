## Future Implementations

We are continuously working to enhance LegalPad with cutting-edge features to empower legal professionals. Here's what's on our roadmap:

### Conversational AI for Legal Documents

The most significant upcoming feature is the integration of a conversational AI, designed to be a powerful assistant for lawyers. This AI will allow you to:

*   **Interact with your documents:** Ask questions about the content of your legal documents in natural language (e.g., "What are the key clauses related to liability?", "Summarize the section on termination.").
*   **Get instant insights:** The AI will provide quick summaries, identify key entities, and highlight important dates and obligations.
*   **Drafting assistance:** Get help with drafting clauses, rephrasing sentences, and ensuring consistency across the document.
*   **Legal research:** The AI will be able to connect to legal databases to provide relevant case law and statutes related to the content of your document.

This feature is being developed to be highly effective for our prime customers at **Vettam.ai**, ensuring that LegalPad is not just a document editor, but a comprehensive legal-tech solution.
